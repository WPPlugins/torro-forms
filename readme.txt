Torro Forms is an extendable WordPress form builder with Drag & Drop functionality, chart evaluation and more - with WordPress look and feel.

== Description ==

Torro Forms is a Drag & Drop form builder plugin that is easy to use for administrators, yet flexible to extend for developers. The plugin was made with both user groups in mind to ensure that you can do exactly what you want without getting stuck in complicated setups. In addition, our plugin looks and behaves in the same way that the rest of WordPress does. If you're tired of seeing bloated, "all-fancy" user interfaces that distract you from what you actually want to achieve - be relieved, we are too.

Torro Forms can serve several purposes. Its functionality goes beyond simple contact forms (although you could of course technically create one if you wanted to). Whether you're interested in a survey solution or whether you need internal forms that you can restrict to a specific group of users - Torro Forms is the way to go. And if you don't find what you've been looking for, be aware that our plugin is extendable via several APIs - we encourage you to do it yourself instead of locking you with what we already provide.

Torro Forms was made with a specific attention to polls and surveys. Form submissions are permanently stored in the database so that they can be browsed, exported and evaluated through charts.

= Key Features =

* **Drag & Drop elements** - Drag elements into your working area and edit them. Look and feel of the form builder are the similar to what you would expect from WordPress.
* **Actions** - Use our built-in actions like page redirections to show your message or send out emails to notify users, yourself or others.
* **Charts** - Every element that can be evaluated, for example a multiple choice field, can be displayed as bar charts and will help you analyze your submissions.
* **Excel & CSV Exports** - Export the results of form submissions into as Excel or CSV file. The export can be created from the form overview or in the form builder.
* **Create element types** - Enhance your forms further by creating custom element types. Our easy-to-use Element Types API makes it possible.
* **Create actions** - Create additional kinds of actions which will be executed whenever the form is submitted successfully by using our Actions API.
* **Extend more...** - Like element types and actions, you can extend Torro Forms in many other ways too by extending specific PHP classes. It's just like creating widgets in WordPress.
* **Code completion** - Our flexible API was made with developers in mind: The `torro()` function acts as a root for easy chaining and autocompletion.
